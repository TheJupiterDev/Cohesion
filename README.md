# Cohesion
_Cohesion aims to fix the mess that is recent Minecraft Updates by adding some Cohesion to the game._

Minecraft's development history is a mess, there's no doubt about it. 
Cohesion aims to tie everything Mojang has added to Minecraft together.

This is a Fabric mod currently for `1.21`.
It will be updated for `1.21.1`, `1.21.2`, `1.21.3`, `1.21.4`, `1.21.5`, and `1.21.6` in the future.

Backports are unlikely.
